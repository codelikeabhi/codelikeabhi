## 👋 Hi there, I'm Abhishek Sriwastav, I've a passion for technology and problem-solving.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science and actively exploring the realms of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Web Development.**

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projectS using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

💬 Ask me about AI, ML, DL, NNs, and Web Dev.

💻 Alongside AI, Ml, and Werb Dev, I also do Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to hone my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

✍️ Fun Fact, I learn faster when I document/share my learnings with others. You can find my articles on AI, Machine Learning, and other tech-related topics in my [Weekly Newsletter](https://damndev.substack.com/). Let's Navigate through the world of AI and Beyond.🚀

🚀 Join me on my coding journey and stay tuned for insightful articles. Let's Connect, Learn, and Grow together!
